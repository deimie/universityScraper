**Admissions Requirements**
Minimum GPA: 2.4 minimum for CA Residents in UC-transferable coursework, or 2.8 minimum for Nonresidents. Competitive applicants exceed the minimum. Selective majors require higher GPA in preparatory courses (e.g., Biology requires a minimum 2.5 GPA in major courses, Economics requires a minimum 2.3 GPA in major courses).
Application Deadlines: The application filing period is October 1–November 30 for the following Fall term.
Required Tests: SAT/ACT scores are not required. AP/IB exam scores of 3 or higher (AP) or 5 or higher (IB Higher Level) may be used for unit credit and to meet GE requirements, but will not count toward the unit limitation.

**Credit Requirements**
Minimum Transferable Units: A minimum of 60 UC-transferable semester units (90 quarter units) by the end of the spring term prior to fall admission.
Maximum Transferable Units: A maximum of 70 semester (105 quarter) units of lower-division coursework will be granted credit. Units earned from AP/IB exams are not included in this limitation.
General Education Certification: The Intersegmental General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) is accepted for the UC system. However, IGETC certification or partial-IGETC completion may not apply toward the full completion of UC San Diego college general education requirements.
Transfer Pathways: UC San Diego **does not participate** in the Transfer Admission Guarantee (TAG) program.
Residency Requirements: Thirty-five of the final forty-five units completed for the bachelor's degree must be earned in residence at the college or school of the University of California in which the degree is to be earned.

**Financial Requirements**
Estimated Annual Cost (Tuition + Fees): For 2025-2026, the estimated UC Systemwide Tuition & Fees for a California Resident is approximately $15,700 (based on UCLA's UC Systemwide Tuition of $14,934 and Campus fees of $766). Nonresident Supplemental Tuition (NRST) is an additional $37,602 (UCLA example).
Transfer-Specific Scholarships: No UCSD-specific transfer scholarships are named. Students should apply for general financial aid via the FAFSA or CADAA and research external transfer scholarships (e.g., Jack Kent Cooke).

**Major Requirements**
Major Selectivity: The following majors/departments are designated as Selective (Impaction): Biological Anthropology; Biological Sciences; Chemistry & Biochemistry; Data Science; Economics; Engineering (all); Environmental Systems; Geosciences; Marine Biology; Mathematics; Oceanic & Atmospheric Sciences; Physics; Public Health; Real Estate & Development; Urban Studies & Planning. Applicants must complete the minimum preparation coursework for these majors to be considered for admission.
Minimum Course Grade: All major preparation screening courses must be completed with a grade of C (2.0) or better, unless otherwise noted for the major.
